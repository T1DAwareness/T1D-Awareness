# Type-1-Diabetes-Awareness-Landing-Page
T1D-Awareness  This is new landing page I've created for a new project I'm working on.  Project - About  T1D Awareness' goal is to bring accurate awareness for Type 1 Diabetes to the general public with the purpose of stopping missed or delayed diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes, which can lead to permanent disabilities or death.  In addition, T1D Awareness also designs high quality apparel pertaining to Type 1 Diabetes that is screen-printed by hand in the USA; a portion of the profit made through the apparel will be donated to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF).  Front End Tech Used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (JQuery)
